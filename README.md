# C10 #

Hi everyone, this is one of the personal projects, 
The project deals with my old idea on subsitution cryptography
which i used to code in school times for fun.

I just brought it back (reason : just for fun) 

## Instructions ##

C10 \[ring-key\] \[E\D\] \[Input_file\] \[Output_file\]

ring-key    : key file to set substitution map, 
E 	        : for Encrypt, 
D 		    : for Decrypt, 
Input_file	: Input file containing plain text, 
Output_file : Output file containing Code (default : Output.txt). 


If any ideas or suggestion whoever looking this project, I'm all ears
